# Port Forward

## ☁️ Purchasing a Domain & Cloudflare Setup

### 💰 Buying your domain

After looking at several domain registrars, I chose to buy a domain from Namecheap. You can buy it from another registrar but make sure it comes with “**whois protection**”. This protects your information from a [public database](https://www.whois.com/), where anyone can use your domain to lookup your email, phone number, and address.

### ❓ What’s Cloudflare?

Cloudflare offers a bunch of services, including making your web connection more secure for free. It acts as a security guard between the URL you’re connecting to and your Unraid Server. You’re also going to be adding extra security by creating your own special certificate.

**Note**: Even though we’re using Cloudflare for this method, we are not using their tunnels. So your data isn’t subject to their visibility.
