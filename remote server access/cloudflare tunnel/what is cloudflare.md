# Cloudflare Tunnel

## ☁️ Purchasing a Domain & Cloudflare Tunnel Setup

### 💰 Buying your domain

After looking at several domain registrars, I chose to buy a domain from Namecheap. You can buy it from another registrar but make sure it comes with “**whois protection**”. This protects your information from a [public database](https://www.whois.com/), where anyone can use your domain to lookup your email, phone number, and address.

### ❓ What's Cloudflare?

Cloudflare offers a bunch of services, including making your web connection more secure for free. With Cloudflare Tunnels (previously known as Zero Trust Tunnel, Argo tunnel), all the information that is sent to and from your Unraid apps goes through their tunnel, connecting you to the web and keeping you protected. For a more detailed explanation, watch [IBRACORP’s Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQ-6dActAr8\&t=) up until the 9-minute mark.
