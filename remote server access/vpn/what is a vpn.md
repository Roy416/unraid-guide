## !? Wireguard vs Tailscale

You may have heard the terms **Wireguard** or **Tailscale** when discussing about VPNs. Wireguard is the actual protocol of the VPN. While Tailscale uses the wireguard protocol. Why choose Tailscale over Wireguard? Wireguard is easy to set up, but Tailscale is even easier.  Tailscale also has other cool features too and is baked right in Unraid.

As of Feb 2025, Tailscale Integration is quite new so there are bound to be future changes and improvements. \
