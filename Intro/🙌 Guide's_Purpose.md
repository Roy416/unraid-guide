# 🙌 Guide's Purpose

If this is your first time building a home lab it can be quite overwhelming, especially after the tedious task of picking out the hardware. So in the spirit of Unraid having an active community, I've created this guide!

This includes guides for the typical services people want. Which include:

- a media server (Plex)
- being able to sync and share files (Nextcloud), 
- backing up photos from your phone (Immich), 
- how to access these outside of your house, and 
- how to back up your stuff.

There are written instructions with accompanying videos and even pictures for the longer setups. So no matter how how you like your guides, you're covered.
